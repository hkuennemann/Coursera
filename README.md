# Coursera Projects

Welcome to my Coursera Projects repository that contains the projects from (soon to be) various Coursera courses I've completed. It serves as a showcase of the practical work and applications of the knowledge gained through these courses. Explore these projects to see detailed implementations, methodologies, and results.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific course. Inside each course directory, you'll find the following subdirectories and files:
- Project Files: The main code, datasets, and other files necessary for the project.
- Documentation: Detailed documentation explaining the content and projects.

## Courses Included

This repository currently includes projects from the following Coursera courses:

### Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing [IBM]

- 🖋️ *Description*: This course covered the fundamentals of computer vision and its applications in various industries, such as self-driving cars and robotics. Using Python, Pillow, and OpenCV, it involved basic image processing, image classification, and object detection. The course was hands-on, with labs combining Jupyter Labs and Computer Vision Learning Studio (CV Studio). It included training and testing custom image classifiers and detection models.<br/>
  
- 🌟 *Skills acquired*: `Image Processing`, `Artificial Intelligence (AI)`, `Opencv`, `Computer Vision`, `Deep Learning`.<br/>
  
- ✅ *Status*: complete<br/>

### Getting Started with Git and GitHub [IBM]

- 🖋️ *Description*: This course was about understanding and applying version control in the context of social and collaborative coding. It covered the basics of Git, including key concepts such as repositories and branches, essential for distributed version control. I learned how to create GitHub repositories, manage branches, and perform pull requests (PRs) and merge operations, enabling effective team collaboration on projects. The course also guided participants in building their portfolios by creating and sharing open-source projects on GitHub.<br/>
  
- 🌟 *Skills acquired*: `Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)`, `Git (Software)`, `GitHub`, `Cloning and forking`.<br/>
  
- ✅ *Status*: complete<br/>

### Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python [IBM]

- 🖋️ *Description*: In this course, I developed a solid understanding of SQL, starting with the basics like writing SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. I learned how to filter and organize data, differentiate between DML and DDL, and manage tables. As I progressed, I was introduced to more advanced topics like JOINs, Stored Procedures, and ACID Transactions, which I found challenging but rewarding.<br/>
I had the chance to practice what I learned through hands-on labs, working with real databases and data science tools. By the end of the course, I felt more confident in my ability to use SQL, especially after applying my skills to analyze real-world datasets in the final project.<br/>
  
- 🌟 *Skills acquired*: `Not yet achieved`.<br/>
  
- ✅ *Status*: WIP<br/>
