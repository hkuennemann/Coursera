# Coursera Projects

Welcome to my Coursera Projects repository that contains the projects from (soon to be) various Coursera courses I've completed. It serves as a showcase of the practical work and applications of the knowledge gained through these courses. Explore these projects to see detailed implementations, methodologies, and results.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific course. Inside each course directory, you'll find the following subdirectories and files:
- Project Files: The main code, datasets, and other files necessary for the project.
- Documentation: Detailed documentation explaining the content and projects.

## Courses Included

This repository currently includes projects from the following Coursera courses:

- **Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing [IBM]** <br/>

  🖋️ *Description*: This course covered the fundamentals of computer vision and its applications in various industries, such as self-driving cars and robotics.
