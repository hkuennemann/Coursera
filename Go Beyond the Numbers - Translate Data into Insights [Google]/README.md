# Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights [Google]
Description: In this course, I learned how to uncover stories within data and present them compellingly. Guided by Google professionals, I practiced exploratory data analysis, created effective visualizations, and applied real-world data storytelling techniques. I used Python to examine, clean, and transform data, validated datasets, and made decisions about missing data and outliers. Additionally, I learned to create accessible visualizations with Tableau and manipulate date strings for better data organization. Completing this program equipped me with the skills needed for advanced data analytics and data science roles.<br/>

**Skills gained in this course**: `Python Programming`, `Effective Communication`, `Tableau Software`, `Data Visualization`, `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`.

## Course Content and Notebooks

### Module 1
Description: I learned how to find stories within data and share them with my audience. I explored the methods and benefits of data cleaning, understanding how it helps uncover those stories. I also went through the steps of the EDA process, gaining insight into how EDA can quickly reveal patterns in data. Finally, I explored various ways to visualize data to effectively communicate key insights.


### Module 2
Description: In this module, I focused on organizing and interpreting raw data to uncover stories using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). I learned how to leverage Python to efficiently perform EDA practices, including discovering patterns and refining data to reveal meaningful insights.
