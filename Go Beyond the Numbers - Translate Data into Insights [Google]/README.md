# Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights [Google]
Description: In this course, I learned how to uncover stories within data and present them compellingly. Guided by Google professionals, I practiced exploratory data analysis, created effective visualizations, and applied real-world data storytelling techniques. I used Python to examine, clean, and transform data, validated datasets, and made decisions about missing data and outliers. Additionally, I learned to create accessible visualizations with Tableau and manipulate date strings for better data organization. Completing this program equipped me with the skills needed for advanced data analytics and data science roles.<br/>

**Skills gained in this course**: `Python Programming`, `Effective Communication`, `Tableau Software`, `Data Visualization`, `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`.

## Course Content and Notebooks

### Module 1 - Find and share stroies using data
Description: I learned how to find stories within data and share them with my audience. I explored the methods and benefits of data cleaning, understanding how it helps uncover those stories. I also went through the steps of the EDA process, gaining insight into how EDA can quickly reveal patterns in data. Finally, I explored various ways to visualize data to effectively communicate key insights.</br>
Submodules:
- Use PACE and inform EDA and data visualizations
- Find and share stories using data


### Module 2 - Explore raw data
Description: In this module, I focused on organizing and interpreting raw data to uncover stories using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). I learned how to leverage Python to efficiently perform EDA practices, including discovering patterns and refining data to reveal meaningful insights.</br>
Submodules:
- "Discovering" is the beginning of an investigation
- Understand the data format
- Create structure from raw data
- Explore raw data

#### Notebooks
2.1.EDA using basic data functions with Python
- Description: In this notebook, I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the <<eda_using_basic_data_functions_in_python_dataset1.csv>> file, derived from the BigQuery public dataset <<noaa_lightning.lightning_strikes>>. The dataset contains aggregated cloud-to-ground lightning strike data from Vaisala's National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN), organized into 0.1Â° latitude by 0.1Â° longitude tiles, with each tile's strikes summed and assigned to central geographic coordinates.<br/>
- Main Topics:
  - EDA on lightning strike data
  - Data aggregation and interpretation
  - Geographic data analysis
  - Python data functions


2.2.EDA_unicornCompanies-1
- Description: This notebook was about exploring a dataset of unicorn companies to gain insights into their characteristics and valuations. I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to discover trends and patterns within the data. I visualized key metrics such as the time it took companies to reach unicorn status and the maximum valuation of companies by industry.<br/>
- Main Topics:
  - Data exploration and analysis
  - Dataset characteristics and structure
  - Data visualization using Python


2.3.Date string manipulations with Python
- Description: This notebook was focused on practicing date string manipulations in Python. I worked with a dataset of lightning strikes from 2016 to 2018, converting date strings to datetime objects, and creating new time-related columns. I then used this data to calculate and visualize weekly and quarterly lightning strike totals. The process involved formatting dates, creating bar graphs, and adding labels to visualize trends in lightning strike data over time.<br/>
- Main Topics:
  - Date string conversion
  - Time column creation
  - Data grouping and summarization
  - Data formatting and labeling
  - Data visualization


2.4.EDA structuring with Python
- Description: In this notebook, I practiced structuring and analyzing lightning strike data in Python, focusing on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) for 2018. The notebook guided me through various data manipulation techniques, including sorting, grouping, and calculating percentages, and culminated in visualizing data patterns over time.<br/>
- Main Topics
  - Datetime Conversion
  - Duplicate Check
  - Data Sorting
  - Grouping & Aggregation
  - Plotting & Visualization
  - Data Concatenation


2.5.EDA_unicornCompanies-2
- Desription: This notebook detailed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) activity focused on structuring and analyzing a dataset of unicorn companies â€” those valued at over one billion dollars. The objective was to gain insights into the dataset by performing various datetime transformations, structuring the data, and using visualizations. I worked with Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib.pyplot` to import, explore, and visualize the data, ultimately uncovering trends and patterns related to the unicorn companies' founding years and valuation over time.<br/>
- Main Topics
  - Data Exploration**
  - Sorting
  - Datetime Conversion
  - Trend Analysis
  - Visualization
  - Results and Evaluation


### Module 3 - Clean your data
Description: In this module, I explored three additional EDA practices: cleaning, joining, and validating. I learned about the importance of these practices for data analysis and used Python to clean, validate, and join data.</br>
Submodules:
- The challenge of missing or duplicate data
- The ins and outs of outliers
- Change categorical to numerical data
- Input validation
- Clean your data

#### Notebooks
3.1.Dealing with missing data in Python
- Description: In this notebook, I analyzed and processed lightning strike data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). The main focus was to handle missing data, identify and address outliers, and perform label encoding on the dataset. The data covered different time periods and locations, requiring merging datasets, visualizing missing data, and encoding categorical variables for better analysis. I also demonstrated how to create meaningful visualizations, such as scatter plots and boxplots, to interpret the data effectively.<br/>
- Main Topics
  - Data Merging
  - Missing Data Analysis
  - Outlier Detection
  - Data Visualization
  - Label Encoding
  - Data Cleaning
  - Categorical Data Handling


3.2.Address missing data
- Description: In this notebook, I addressed missing data and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of unicorn companies. I acted as a financial data consultant to identify potential business opportunities for an investor. The analysis involved cleaning the data, handling missing values, and filtering specific company information to meet the investor's requirements. I also generated visualizations to present the findings effectively<br/>
- Main Topics:
  - Data Exploration
  - Data Cleaning
  - Handling Missing Values
  - Data Filtering
  - Data Visualization


3.3.Validate and clean your data.ipynb
- Description: In this notebook, I focused on validating and cleaning a dataset containing information about unicorn companies. My task involved several steps to prepare the data for analysis, including handling incorrect data types, correcting data entry errors, dealing with duplicates, and converting categorical data into numerical form.<br/>
Main Topics: 
  - Data Type Conversion
  - Data Cleaning
  - Input Validation
  - Handling Duplicates
