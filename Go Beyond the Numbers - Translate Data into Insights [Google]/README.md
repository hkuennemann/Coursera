# Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights [Google]
Description: In this course, I learned how to uncover stories within data and present them compellingly. Guided by Google professionals, I practiced exploratory data analysis, created effective visualizations, and applied real-world data storytelling techniques. I used Python to examine, clean, and transform data, validated datasets, and made decisions about missing data and outliers. Additionally, I learned to create accessible visualizations with Tableau and manipulate date strings for better data organization. Completing this program equipped me with the skills needed for advanced data analytics and data science roles.<br/>

**Skills gained in this course**: `Python Programming`, `Effective Communication`, `Tableau Software`, `Data Visualization`, `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`.

## Course Content and Notebooks

### Module 1
Description: I learned how to find stories within data and share them with my audience. I explored the methods and benefits of data cleaning, understanding how it helps uncover those stories. I also went through the steps of the EDA process, gaining insight into how EDA can quickly reveal patterns in data. Finally, I explored various ways to visualize data to effectively communicate key insights.


### Module 2
Description: In this module, I focused on organizing and interpreting raw data to uncover stories using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). I learned how to leverage Python to efficiently perform EDA practices, including discovering patterns and refining data to reveal meaningful insights.

#### Notebooks
2.1.fAnnotated follow-along guide_EDA using basic data functions with Python
- Description: In this notebook, I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `eda_using_basic_data_functions_in_python_dataset1.csv` file, derived from the BigQuery public dataset `noaa_lightning.lightning_strikes`. The dataset contains aggregated cloud-to-ground lightning strike data from Vaisala's National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN), organized into 0.1Â° latitude by 0.1Â° longitude tiles, with each tile's strikes summed and assigned to central geographic coordinates.<br/>
- Main Topics:
  - EDA on lightning strike data
  - Data aggregation and interpretation
  - Geographic data analysis
  - Python data functions


2.2.Unicorn valuation.ipynb
- Description: This notebook was about exploring a dataset of unicorn companies to gain insights into their characteristics and valuations. I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to discover trends and patterns within the data. I visualized key metrics such as the time it took companies to reach unicorn status and the maximum valuation of companies by industry.<br/>
- Main Topics:
  - Data exploration and analysis
  - Dataset characteristics and structure
  - Data visualization using Python


2.3.Guide_Date string manipulations with Python
- Description: This notebook was focused on practicing date string manipulations in Python. I worked with a dataset of lightning strikes from 2016 to 2018, converting date strings to datetime objects, and creating new time-related columns. I then used this data to calculate and visualize weekly and quarterly lightning strike totals. The process involved formatting dates, creating bar graphs, and adding labels to visualize trends in lightning strike data over time.<br/>
- Main Topics:
  - Date string conversion
  - Time column creation
  - Data grouping and summarization
  - Data formatting and labeling
  - Data visualization
