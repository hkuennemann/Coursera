# Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing [IBM]
Description from Coursera: Computer Vision is one of the most exciting fields in Machine Learning and AI. It has applications in many industries, such as self-driving cars, robotics, augmented reality, and much more. In this beginner-friendly course, you will understand computer vision and learn about its various applications across many industries.

As part of this course, you will utilize Python, Pillow, and OpenCV for basic image processing and perform image classification and object detection.

This is a hands-on course and involves several labs and exercises. Labs will combine Jupyter Labs and Computer Vision Learning Studio (CV Studio), a free learning tool for computer vision. CV Studio allows you to upload, train, and test your own custom image classifier and detection models.  At the end of the course, you will create your own computer vision web app and deploy it to the Cloud.

This course does not require any prior Machine Learning or Computer Vision experience. However, some knowledge of the Python programming language and high school math is necessary.

## Course Content and Notebooks
### Module 1
Description from Coursera: In this module, we will discuss the rapidly developing field of image processing. In addition to being the first step in Computer Vision, it has broad applications ranging anywhere from making your smartphone's image look crystal clear to helping doctors cure diseases.

### Module 2
Description from Coursera: Image processing enhances images or extracts useful information from the image. In this module, we will learn the basics of image processing with Python libraries OpenCV and Pillow.

Notebooks:
- 2.1.1_Images_with_python_library_PIL
  - Description: This notebook provides an introduction to image processing with Python. It covers essential techniques such as loading, displaying, and manipulating images using the `Pillow` (PIL) library, and converting images to `NumPy` arrays for advanced processing. Key operations include working with image files, grayscale conversion, color channels, and quantization.
  - Main Topics:
    - *Python Image Libraries*: Overview of image processing tools in Python.
    - *Image Files and Paths*: Handling file formats and paths.
    - *Loading Images*: Using Pillow to open and display images.
    - *Plotting Images*: Visualizing images with Matplotlib.
    - *Grayscale Conversion*: Converting and analyzing grayscale images.
    - *Quantization*: Reducing color levels and observing effects.
    - *Color Channels*: Extracting and analyzing RGB channels.
    - *NumPy Arrays*: Converting Pillow images to NumPy arrays for manipulation.
