# Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing [IBM]

## Project Notebooks
- 2.1.1_Images_with_python_library_PIL
  - Description: This notebook provides an introduction to image processing with Python. It covers essential techniques such as loading, displaying, and manipulating images using the `Pillow` (PIL) library, and converting images to `NumPy` arrays for advanced processing. Key operations include working with image files, grayscale conversion, color channels, and quantization.
  - Main Topics:
    - *Python Image Libraries*: Overview of image processing tools in Python.
    - *Image Files and Paths*: Handling file formats and paths.
    - *Loading Images*: Using Pillow to open and display images.
    - *Plotting Images*: Visualizing images with Matplotlib.
    - *Grayscale Conversion*: Converting and analyzing grayscale images.
    - *Quantization*: Reducing color levels and observing effects.
    - *Color Channels*: Extracting and analyzing RGB channels.
    - *NumPy Arrays*: Converting Pillow images to NumPy arrays for manipulation.
